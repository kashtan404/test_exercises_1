## Description <h2> tag
Accroding to 1st "Programming" and "Docker", I did 2 versions:
1st - As it mentioned in exercise
2nd - How I would do it if it were in production

It builds docker image and run it.

**Usage** (for both):
```
./build_and_run.sh <api_key> <city_name>
```

Ansible task: just a simple playbook and a shell script to run it.

**Usage** (you will be asked for password):
```
./install_docker.sh
```

**Programming**

NOTE: Although below Python is mentioned, any of the following programming languages are
accepted: Python, Ruby, Golang, C/C++, Java.

Create a simple python script getweather.py with the following specs

- Retrieves weather data from https://openweathermap.org/api
- It uses the current weather data API: https://openweathermap.org/current
- It uses pyown: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyowm
- The python script uses no arguments, only the following environment variables:
  - OPENWEATHER_API_KEY
  - CITY_NAME
- It outputs to stdout

Example of acceptable results:
```
$ export
declare -x OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxx"
declare -x CITY_NAME="Honolulu"
$ python getweather.py
source=openweathermap, city="Honolulu", description="few clouds", temp=70.2,
humidity=75
```
**Ansible**

All steps below must be done using Ansible:
- Install the Docker service
- Enable container logging to Docker host's syslog file [1]

NOTE: Settings for privilege escalation and modularisation are acceptable (become: yes,
ansible-roles, etc)

Example of expected result:
$ docker
```
The program 'docker' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt install docker.io
$ ansible-playbook -i "localhost," -c local site.yml
...
...
PLAY RECAP *********
localhost : ok=9 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0
$ docker -v
Docker version 17.12.0-ce, build c97c6d6
$ docker info | grep 'Logging Driver'
Logging Driver: syslog
```

**Docker**

- Build a docker image (Dockerfile) configured to run as executable
- The docker container should pack the getweather.py script

Example of expected result:
```
$ docker run --rm -e OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxx" -e CITY_NAME="Honolulu"
weather:dev
$ grep openweathermap /var/log/syslog
